# TODO
*'The Wall of Text has awoken!'*

A big list of everything that needs done or should be looked into across all of my mods.

# Shardion's Many Modifications

- This mod needs a huge internal restructuring, if not an entire rewrite.
  Its code is very messy and hard to understand, there are many warnings, and sins comparable to those of the Terraria codebase itself.
- The amount of dead and unused content in this mod is astounding.
  This needs cleaned up very badly.
- Bosses should start dropping some annoying materials. Notably, Skeletron should drop Bones,
  Eater of Worlds should drop Rotten Chunks, Brain of Cthulhu should drop Vertebra, and Plantera should drop Chlorophyte Ore.

# Shardion's Odd Encounter

This mod's todo list is too big for just this file; it includes an entire set of attacks for Oddity which need implemented.
See `Shardion.Ether/ODDITY.md` for that.

# Project Flashback

- This mod needs a name. Its original name was `Shardion's Various Vanities`, but I don't feel that applies, now that it's not just about the quantity.
- Look into IL edits instead of custom draw layers for layered clothing drawing.
- Make a metric ton of vanity items intended to be used with layered clothing.
