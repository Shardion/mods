# TODO
*'The Wall of Text has awoken!'*

A big list of everything that needs done or should be looked into across all of my mods.

# Clientside Lag Prevention

- Replace the reflection with a faster method of replacing the lighting engine, or make the reflection method run less often.
- Add support for disabling shaders and background clouds.

# Shardion's Many Modifications

- This mod needs a complete rewrite and redesign. Most features should be dropped.
  Everything left should be genuine improvements, instead of "quality of life" cheat codes to skip the less challening parts of the game.
- Add a few overpowered developer items. :trollface:

# Shardion's Odd Encounter

This mod's todo list is too big for just this file; it includes an entire set of attacks for Oddity which need implemented.
See `Shardion.Ether/ODDITY.md` for that.

# Project Flashback

- Separate Flashback and Many Modifications. Many Modifications was originally what Flashback intends to be (a vanity mod), but it ballooned in scope.
- Decide on a name. `Vanity Layering` is fine, but needs more consideration.
- Look into IL edits instead of custom draw layers for layered clothing drawing.
- Layered clothing support for head and legs.
- Add a way to make layered clothing in-game (probably a special furniture item, a la Calamity's Codebreaker).

# DOOM In Terraria

- Add support for playing audio, and allow capturing the keyboard, so you can actually play the game.
