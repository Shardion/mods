Project Flashback adds support for layering multiple vanity (or armor) items on top of eachother, as well as some new, more contemporary vanity items intended for use with the feature.
This is done through a new furniture item, the Fitting Table.

Layered vanity items do not function as armor, even if armor is used to make them.
Layered vanity items cannot be dyed directly, but the individual items that compose them can be dyed at the Fitting Table.
The items used in a layered vanity item cannot be recovered. 
(It's a good idea to test them with cheats first, before using them in a playthrough.)
