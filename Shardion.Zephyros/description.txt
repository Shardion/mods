Shardion's Many Modifications adds... well, many (small) modifications to Terraria.
Generally, these are intended to make the game more fun, or to patch up large balancing issues.

It currently adds the following, all of which can be disabled in the configuration (most without a reload!):
- Quality of Life
+ Discount Cookie, a consumable item that permanently grants the Discount Card effect (and does not stack with it)
+ Glowing Mushroom biome enemies drop Mushroom Grass Seeds
+ Crates can be upgraded, downgraded and converted to other crates
+ Gems can be converted to other gems
+ Chlorophyte Bars are cheaper to make

- Balancing
+ Magiluminescence moved to post-evil boss
+ Soaring Insignia and Gravity Globe swapped to Moon Lord and Empress of Light, respectively
+ Terraspark Boots moved to post-all mechanical bosses
+ Molotov Cocktail requires 5 Gel instead of 1 Pink Gel
+ Destroyer Probe and Gastropod lasers glow, like all other lasers

- Vanity
+ Immaterial Dye, a material crafted out of any three dye materials that turns into one of any base dye
+ Familiar Set craftable pre-boss with Mana Crystals
+ All planter boxes are always sold by the Dryad
