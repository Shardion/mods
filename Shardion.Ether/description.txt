Adds a single post-Moonlord boss.

- Themed around weaponry, light and justice.
- Primarily, a fun dodging challenge.
- Includes some nice visual effects.
- A face from a land long forgotten.

There is no reward for defeating the boss, outside of potions and coins.

This boss is designed around vanilla Terraria gear, and you will not have the intended
experience if you use anything that modifies vanilla Terraria balancing, including:

- Gear from content mods that balance around themselves
- Extra accessory slots
- New potions

Shoutouts to Tomat and everyone else who works on Rejuvena.Collate for making this possible.
