# Shardion's mods monorepo

This repository contains the source code for every single Terraria mod I've made.

## Building

All mods in this repository require Rejuvena.Collate to build, and as such cannot be built in-game (for now).
To build these mods, you must first download Collate (`dotnet restore` if using the .NET CLI), and then you can build the mods with your IDE of choice (`dotnet build` for CLI).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Just remember these two guidelines:

- Please format your code!
  There should be a menu option in your IDE of choice (or you can run `dotnet format`). It helps me and other contributors read your code, so we can get it merged sooner.
- If you don't understand something, ask!
  I will gladly walk you through the code of my mods ([make an issue](https://github.com/shardion/mods/issues/new) or ask in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/PRYhCSeCNu)), and you can always ask the [tModLoader discord](https://discord.gg/tmodloader) and read the [tModLoader documentation](https://tmodloader.github.io/tModLoader/docs/1.4-stable/) for help with general tModLoader topics.
