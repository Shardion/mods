# shardion's mods

The code to all of the mods I've wrote.

Each mod has its own license file, placed in its project directory.
(For example, Clientside Lag Prevention's license is readable at [ClientsideLagPrevention/LICENSE](https://github.com/Shardion/mods/blob/main/ClientsideLagPrevention/LICENSE).

The rest of the code in this repository (all of the stuff at the root, like this `README.md` you're reading now) is dedicated to the public domain with The Unlicense, which can be viewed at [/LICENSE](https://github.com/Shardion/mods/blob/main/LICENSE).
