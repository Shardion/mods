A mod which introduces methods of reducing client-side lag.
All of the mod's changes can be disabled, constantly enabled, or enabled only if a boss is alive.
Because it's client-side, you can use this mod on servers which don't have it.

All lag-reduction measures included as are follows:

- Skip resolving and drawing black areas of the screen
- Disable processing of rain, combat text, dust, and gore

Changelog:

v2.0.1
- The mod is now properly client-side again. It previously was not due to a
  build.txt misconfiguration.

v2.0.0
- The mod works again.
- Disabling the lighting engine removes the RenderBlack method and its
  tile resolution logic, finally giving an actual FPS improvement!
- Rain, combat text, dust and gore prevention now removes all of the
  drawing and updating logic, improving performance in these areas.
- Fixed translation keys in the menus. Sorry about that.
- Removed item culling since it didn't help and was too much work.
- Removed the license and source code buttons in the config.
  Don't worry, the mod is still open source, under the same license, at
  [c/0000FF:https://github.com/shardion/mods].
- Moved away from Rejuvena.Collate, since it constantly broke, isn't
  supported, and doesn't help much.
