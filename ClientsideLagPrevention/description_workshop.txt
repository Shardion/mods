A mod which introduces methods of reducing client-side lag.
All of the mod's changes can be disabled, constantly enabled, or enabled only if a boss is alive.
Because it's client-side, you can use this mod on servers which don't have it.

All lag-reduction measures included as are follows:

[list]
[*] Skip resolving and drawing black areas of the screen
[*] Disable processing of rain, combat text, dust, and gore
[/list]

Changelog:

v2.0.0
- The mod works again.
- Disabling the lighting engine removes the [code]RenderBlack[/code] method and its
  tile resolution logic, finally giving an actual FPS improvement!
- Rain, combat text, dust and gore prevention now removes all of the
  drawing and updating logic, improving performance in these areas.
- Fixed translation keys in the menus. Sorry about that.
- Removed item culling since it didn't help and was too much work.
- Removed the license and source code buttons in the config.
  Don't worry, the mod is [url=https://github.com/shardion/mods/]still open source, under the same license.[/url]
- Moved away from Rejuvena.Collate, since it constantly broke, isn't
  supported, and doesn't help much.
