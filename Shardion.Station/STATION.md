# Project Station

Project Station is a complete reimagining of Terraria.
Station is still a sandbox game at heart, but carefully weaves new systems and a new narrative into the boss-slaying action of Terraria.

# Story
*'Or what pieces of one I can make'*
(A quick warning: you are about to read a garbage story for a Terraria mod, written by a programmer. Enough said.)

## A quick overview
The player is a settler in a new continent (the world they generate).
This continent is the source of many magical artifacts drifting onto the otherwise boring shores of their tyrannical home. <!-- Yes, it's just Fruma. I'm aware. -->

Enticed by the prospect of a better life (and not getting killed), they agree to be one of the first to go to the new continent and explore.

Somewhat obviously, they discover a new people; peaceful magicians who focus on research and advancement.
Under no supervision (the leaders were too scared to travel to the continent themselves), the player is allowed to interact with these people.

The player's express goal is to explore and send things back to their home for research (think Journey Mode, but without duplication).
Doing this drops some nice lore, and more importantly, actually drops some useful credits which can be spent to avoid grinding for stuff like Hermes Boots.

About 70% of the way into the game (around Skeletron in the short-term plans, but if this was a whole game, it'd be around Golem), the player learns of the
intentions of their old leader; to take over the continent and use its artifacts to amass more power.
Knowing the peaceful inhabitants of the land can't really defend themselves, the player gears up to fight off whatever forces may invade.

## The full thing
Needs a writer to go through and actually describe all of this. <!-- I don't feel like keeping my incomplete garbage writing in the public eye. -->
