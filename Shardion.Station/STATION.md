# Project Station

Project Station is a complete reimagining of Terraria.

Station attempts to make Terraria into a completely new experience.

Station is still a sandbox game at heart, but carefully weaves new systems and a new narrative into the boss-slaying action of Terraria.

## Story
*'Or what pieces of one I can make'*

The scientists of the Resonan people have made a discovery. Outlandish-looking items drifting onto their shores originate from a previously-unknown continent.

This continent has been named "Paradise", due to the nature of the artifacts from the place.

### The Discovery

TODO: Should be soon after the player arrives; found through early surface exploration.

While exploring the new lands, a fateful discovery is made.

A village.

A village of an undiscovered people. Aliens of our own world.



A monumental discovery! A peaceful race of wizards.

### The Niso Arc

TODO: Somehow the player learns of Niso's intentions. Should be 75% of the way through the game.

He intends to take over the peaceful continent and harness its magical resources to then conquer the world.

The player informs the Paradisian leaders.
