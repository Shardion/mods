A mod which introduces numerous advanced methods of reducing client-side lag.
Most lag-reduction measures can be enabled constantly or only if a boss is alive, but all can be disabled.
Because it's client-side, you can use this mod on servers which don't have it.

All lag-reduction measures included as are follows:

- Disable creation of rain, combat text, dust, gores
- Completely disable the lighting engine
- Disable redundant rendering of off-screen dropped items, or all dropped items
