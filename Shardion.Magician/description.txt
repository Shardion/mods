A client-side lag prevention mod, because for some reason, there's no good client-side ones.

If a boss is alive, fullbright is enabled, and all dust, gore, rain and combat text gets deleted.

Each of these behaviors can be disabled in the config.
Additionally, dust, gore, rain and combat text deletion can also be enabled all the time, even if a boss is not alive.

Because it's client-side, you can use this mod on servers which don't have it.
